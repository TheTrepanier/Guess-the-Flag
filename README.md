### Intro
A simple SwiftUI project that uses stacks, buttons, alerts, and more.

### Challenge
- [x] Add an `@State` property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert.
- [x] Show the player’s current score in a label directly below the flags.
- [x] When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
